# Authentication
Register.php is the main start of the authentication process.
Do register as user and change the 1st user to admin in the phpmyadmin mysqli and that admin can add other admin to the site and will also have the admin panel to control all the works.
Admin will be able to view admin home page, while normal user can only view index page.
